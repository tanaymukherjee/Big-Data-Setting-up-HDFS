# Big-Data: Setting up HDFS

The idea is to use java and set up our own HDFS system.

We can then create our own nodes and each node can be accessed using pig/hive langauge

The setting up is based on java language to call map reduce functions.

The entire project ste up is too big to be uploaded here in GitHub, so I have uploaded steps, command lines screenshots and methods for people to follow.
